EXPLANATION

    Basically I had to tear everything down because my ISP is angry with me,
possibly for 3 reasons.
    One factor might be that they didn't like the way I had my 9TB of films,
series, software, music and leaks so _accidentally_ open to the internet.
    Then, hosting a Tor node, albeit middle, my IP shows up on all Tor
blocklists regardless. Why is the internet so paranoid?
    Also I was known to them for "the previous event", funny really, explained below.

THE EVENT
    One evening I was traveling with no cell coverage, and when I returned home
I find ARFNET with no backbone, so I call the ISP and they basically said
that there was a cyberattack coming from my IP to a corporation. Absolutely no 
further details.
    So I can only think of two things, someone got into my systems and pivoted 
through me (unlikely?) or some scared ass sysadmin saw their computers querying 
ARFNET for NTP (ntp.pool.org) and detected that the endpoint is also a middle 
Tor relay. Calling an ISP for that reason is moronically stupid and I shame
whomever is responsible.
    So after a few days without internet, revising auditing everything, shutting
off VMs and stuff, they restored my backbone again. This was a very very close
call, and the reason ARFNET was shot down by me. There is this guy in my ISP 
that is just too good. He stopped the internal process of just straight out 
canceling my service permanently, and I'm very grateful for it.
    So I'm not risking it anymore, I'm not doing anything remotely dangerous or
shady ever again on my public IP (apparently email is very fucking dangerous).
Now, worry not, this is not the end of ARFNET as we know it, the shady stuff
will return, but in a external IP address, not risking my connection. Probably
a VPS in Russia or some shit, yeah, where DMCAs don't apply.

THE PREVIOUS EVENT
    Basically I misconfigured the Postfix SMTP server and it was acting like
a open relay. Which would have been fine if we were in the 90s, but it turns out
the internet is filled with spammers in the look for permissive SMTP servers
to spam people, and the internet is very fucking paranoid of spammers so they 
have this stupid silly blacklists of IPs. They started spamming through me
thousends and thousends of mails, so I got into seven of those blacklists,
until my ISP shot my backbone down, only THEN I noticed. So I closed the Postfix
and they were good enough to open the backbone again.
    Only later I configured it correctly and opened it to it finally working.
