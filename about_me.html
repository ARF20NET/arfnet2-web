                    Hello there, I'm arf20, a 18 y/o bi femboy student from Spain
                    obsessed with technology, hardware and software.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My passions and hobbies are: Linux, systems programming,
                    servers (hardware and administration), networking,
                    electronics (analog, digital and radiofrequency),
                    and retrocomputing. I mostly find expensive professional
                    technology super fascinating.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I really align myself with Free (as in Freedom!) and Open Source
                    and Right to Repair movements, trying to use free software wherever
                    I can. My favorite distro is Debian and I run it everywhere but
                    my phone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm currently studying Computer Science at Universidad de Murcia since 2023,
                    first year. I think this is my place tbh, nice people, great projects.
                </p>

                <h2>Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty fluent in C/C++, MIPS, Z80 and x86 assembly,
                    some Java too. I usually use CMake or Make as build systems.
                    In terms of web, I know PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS and a
                    bit of JS. Good use of Git version control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm knoledgeable in system administration of Web hosts using the
                    linux/nginx/mariadb stack, email with postfix/dovecot and a number of others.
                    I am familiar with Proxmox virtualization as well as linux containers,
                    systemd and general linux administration but also *BSD and Solaris.
                </p>
                <p>
                    About network administration, I'm ok at OPNSense/pfSense firewalling,
                    segregation, VLANs, tunnels, VPNs, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hardware-wise, I've come knees deep with DELL R-series server hardware
                    and its management, and of course a fair bit of PC building.
                    In terms of networking, Mikrotik, Cisco and DELL PowerConnect I experienced.
                </p>

                <h2>Misc</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a native Spanish speaker, and I've been told I'm pretty
                    good at English too, although oficially I currently only hold a B2 by OIE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Random things I have are, HE IPv6 Certification, CEPT Radioamateur License (EA5JGX),
                    ARPA membership on SDF, and interestingly Galileo Mastermind prize and HackUPC 2024.
